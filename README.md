Learn Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in PHP
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a type of programming added to php5 that
makes building complex, modular and reusable web applications that much easier.
With the release of php5, php programmers finally had the power to code with the
'big boys'. Like Java and C#, php finally has a complete OOP infrastructure.
In this tutorial, you will be guided (step-by-step) through the process of building and
working with objects using php's built-in OOP capabilities. At the same time you will
learn:
• The difference between building a php application the old fashioned (procedural)
way, versus the OOP way.
• What the basic OOP principles are, and how to use them in PHP.
• When you would want to use OOP in your PHP scripts.
People run into confusion when programming because of some lack of
understanding of the basics. With this in mind, we are going to slowly go over key
OOP principles while creating our own PHP objects. With this knowledge, you will
be able to explore OOP further.
For this tutorial, you should understand a few PHP basics: functions, variables,
conditionals and loops.
To make things easy, the tutorial is divided into 23 steps.
